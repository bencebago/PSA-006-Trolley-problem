# Generate random values based on provided parameters
# This function samples n integer values between a floor and a ceiling
# The probability of the values are calculated based on a truncated normal distribution of a known
# mean and standard deviation
# OUTPUT: a vector of n random values
# EXAMPLE: draw_values(n = 10000, mean = 5, sd = 2, floor = 1, ceiling = 9)
